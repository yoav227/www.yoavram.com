body:

I am an undergrad student, pursuing a BSc in bioinformatics. 

As a part of my project at the lab I am replicating previous genetic models for human handedness to test their ability to account for current data. 

Alongside my academic interests, I enjoy hiking, scuba diving, and learning new things.
