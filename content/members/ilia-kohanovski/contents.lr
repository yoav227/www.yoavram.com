body:

After experiencing software engineer roles in different startups and big companies for years, I was inspired to continue as a researcher, finding the field of computational evolution especially exciting.

My main interests as software engineer were to build large distributed systems, data science, algorithms, and machine learning, but I tried myself as mobile and web developer as well.

I find biological evolution magical and my goal is to study its processes deeply.

As a researcher, my fields of interests are evolution (biological, cultural and artificial), stochastic processes, statistics, computer simulations, data visualization, etc.

In my spare time, I enjoy going out into nature, walking and trekking. I like live concerts (jazz, rock and more), boxing, climbing and reading.
