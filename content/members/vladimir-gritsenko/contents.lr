body:

I am a software developer-turned-biologist. I like solving problems, both practical and theoretical. Currently, I am studying the evolution of drug resistance in pathogenic Candida fungi. Both my professional and research experience has taught me that an interdisciplinary approach is key to truly understanding and solving a problem. Therefore, in my research I seek to understand both the mechanism (from a cell biology and genetics perspective) and the evolution and population dynamics of the emergence of drug resistance. Consequently, I aim to become proficient both in "wet lab" and "dry lab" work.

Outside of science, I enjoy reading, playing fingerstyle guitar, and raising cats (as of now, only one cat).

I am currently supported by a fellowship from the Edmond J. Safra Center for Bioinformatics at Tel Aviv University.
