body:

I am a PhD student at TU Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, working on improving the microbiome sequencing pipeline with Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann and Dirk Haller. I have a background in biology and public health, but always had a strong interest in statistics and bioinformatics. No matter if I am designing computational pipelines to correct biases in microbiome data or analyzing food recipes to study cultural evolution, I am always interested in learning new methodologies and finding a signal in the noise of data. Apart from that, I am interested in data visualization and computational reproducibility, and I have a passion for photography, arts and cooking.
